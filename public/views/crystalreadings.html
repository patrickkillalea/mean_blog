        <h3>I'm fortunate enough to be able to feel the energy of crystals on a tangible level. So, if you've ever wondered what the purpose of that pretty rock is that you have, I can tell you!</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>I'll often watch people come across crystals and be inexplicably drawn to them, and even though they often have no idea what their point is, adults and children alike find something alluring about them. If you have found this yourself, you are experiencing your awareness of their energy! Although their energy is subtle, simply by spending time sitting and tuning into them, any one of us could then begin to feel their energy on profound levels</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>I'm able to tap into their consciousness (yes, crystals/rocks/minerals are living beings) and engage in a dialogue with them. From there, I can channel their primary properties and the lessons they wish to impart to the wearer</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Though it may seem strange or whacky to consider crystals as alive, the fact is, they simply are – and they are powerful! In the 1950s, scientists discovered that silicon and carbon exhibit the same properties of fostering life – in fact, they are thought to be the only two elements known to create life. For example, silicon is the main element found in quartz crystal, and when we consider that anything organic that features silicon as its biological make-up is alive, it's reasonable to say that crystals themselves have a level of aliveness – whether they feature carbon, or not: "Science has found life-forms deep in the ocean that are alive, conscious, and reproductive, whose bodies are made up of 100% silicon, with no carbon whatsoever" (Toy, A. 2013)</h3>

            <p style="margin:10px;">"<strong>Silicon</strong> is used in every single computer and cell phone processor, and <strong>liquid crystals</strong> comprise the display screens of these devices. <strong>Quartz</strong> (a type of silicate mineral) is used in watches and clocks to help them tell time, because it helps stabilize and regulate the flow of energy. Earlier this year, The Mind Unleashed <a target="_blank" style="color:blue;" href="http://themindunleashed.org/2014/02/data-storage-crystal-quartz-will-change-everything.html"> reported how a clear piece of Quartz crystal</a> can be used to store data for up to 300 million years! <strong>Galena</strong> and <strong>Pyrite</strong> can be used to make radio receivers that do not rely on batteries. <strong>Ruby</strong> crystals were an important part of the first ever laser developed by Bell Laboratories in the 1960’s, and it is still used today for its abilities to focus and concentrate energy. Just this week, it was revealed that a <strong>synthesized crystalline material</strong> can be used to <a target="_blank" style="color:blue;" href="http://themindunleashed.org/2014/10/scientists-create-material-allow-us-breathe-underwater-without-oxygen-tanks.html"> help human beings breathe underwater</a>" </p>
