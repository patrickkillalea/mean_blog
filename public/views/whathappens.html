        <h3>The following is what I believe and how I've experienced readings to work. We’re all mediums, in a sense. We channel our higher selves whilst in incarnation here. Our soul, in the spirit world, is linked energetically through a channel to our conscious, human perspective. Our guides, loved ones, and other beings of love, can dovetail through this channel, impressing thoughts, messages, signs and ideas that serve us – this is, of course, all mediated by our soul. As we become more spiritually awakened and open, we can become more conscious of the way our soul, and other streams of consciousness, sends us messages through our channel</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>During a reading, a psychic medium consciously opens their channel to guides and departed loved ones to receive knowledge, messages of guidance and evidence of their continuous existence. They receive this information at an energetic level – more specifically, at a vibrational, energetic level. The psychic medium receives this, interprets this and translates it into physical word equivalents. For me as a medium, communication with spirit is a personal connection and is akin to learning another language – a vibrational energy-language. Just like linguistic translators, interpreters of energy hone their skill of translation over time. This could take years for some, and it can come more readily and naturally for others. It’s dependent on that individual’s personal development, and how much interference they have distorting that feed of information through their channel – this interference being caused by factors such as lack of confidence, for example, or unresolved past traumas that are creating energetic hindrances at subconscious levels. Essentially, the aim for me as a medium is to become as self-aware and as in alignment with my truest self as possible, so as to provide the purest reading for my sitters</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>Nonetheless, there are many variables with interpreting Spirit – just as the case is for a linguistic translator. There are so many elements to it. Still, Spirit will always ensure that the right evidence is transmitted through the channeler, to ensure that the sitter knows and feels the validity of the connection. So during a reading, be open, be patient, and allow yourself to know what Spirit is telling you through the medium’s interpretation and choice of words. Know that only you can know what is best for you, but also know that spirit love you and are wanting to look out for you regardless</h3>

        <h2 align="center">What’s the purpose of a reading?</h2>
        <br>
        <h3>The purpose of a reading is to help you understand yourself better, to make sense of your past, present and future, and to help put you in alignment with your soul’s journey. A reader can also become aware of your deepest heart’s desires, and can often see this in the pipeline for you, giving you that motivation and excitement to align with your soul and pursue that path. It’s up to us as individuals to create our reality and to rendezvous with what our soul has in store for us – we have free will, remember. Of course, the purpose of a reading is also to validate the continuous existence of our soul and our loved ones, and their presence around us. So, enjoy your reading! Let it open you up to the magic of life! Let it awaken and inspire you into alignment with your destiny! We are love – and we are loved – a reading will reveal this to you</h3>
